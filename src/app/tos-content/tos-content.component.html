              Senior foreign political figure means a senior official in the
              executive, legislative, administrative, military or judicial
              branches of a foreign government (whether elected or not), a
              senior official of a major foreign political party or a senior
              executive of a foreign government-owned corporation. In addition a
              senior foreign political figure includes any corporation, business
              or other entity that has been formed by, or for the benefit of, a
              senior foreign political figure. The immediate family of a senior
              foreign political figure typically includes the political figure's
              parents, siblings, spouse, children and in-laws. A close associate
              of a senior foreign political figure is a person who is widely and
              publicly known internationally to maintain an unusually close
              relationship with the senior foreign political figure, and
              includes a person who is in a position to conduct substantial
              domestic and international financial transactions on behalf of the
              senior foreign political figure.</span
